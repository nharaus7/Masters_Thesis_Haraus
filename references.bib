abstract="Optimizing the vehicle mobility is an important goal in the design and operation of wheeled robots intended to perform on soft, unstructured terrain. In the case of vehicles operating on soft soil, mobility is not only a kinematic concept, but it is related to the traction developed at the wheel-ground interface and cannot be separated from terramechanics. Poor mobility may result in the entrapment of the vehicle or limited manoeuvring capabilities. This paper discusses the effect of normal load distribution among the wheels of an exploration rover and proposes strategies to modify this distribution in a convenient way to enhance the vehicle ability to generate traction. The reconfiguration of the suspension and the introduction of actuation on previously passive joints were the strategies explored in this research. The effect of these actions on vehicle mobility was assessed with numerical simulation and sets of experiments, conducted on a six-wheeled rover prototype. Results confirmed that modifying the normal load distribution is a suitable technique to improve the vehicle behaviour in certain manoeuvres such as slope climbing.",
